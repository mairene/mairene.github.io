      In short, I am a huge believer of "if not A, then B"​ when it comes to the rat-race of career pursuit; if choice A is not working, then go after choice B. I've always fervently gone down paths I've been passionate about, which has led me from being a risk analyst at Citigroup to being a medical assistant in Papua New Guinea in pursuit of the health industry with hopes of attacking "big world problems"​. I realized the best way to contribute was to combine both my love for building something meaningful and impactful on the world with my technically-prone mind: I am a newly-minted full stack engineer.

      I spent two years in Excel manipulating and analyzing data in the financial services industry right out of college. I found that the theoretical logic and proofs I learned in school were not being used and my propensity for number understanding was not being challenged. Most importantly, I realized that my technical skills did not amount to much if they were not being applied in an industry I cared for. I switched to dabbling my way through various roles in the most altruistic industry I could think of at the time: the medical industry. It was not until my most recent role as a content intern at a health non-profit did the need to fulfill the technical side of me become apparent. I have the experience in a data setting, the big-picture hope of helping people, and the aesthetic-eye from the part-time job I worked on the side in a design-focused Japanese company (MUJI). Having now dipped my foot in some aspects of back-end and front-end, I am eager to be on the developer side and simultaneously keep design in mind in an industry that matters to me.

      I am now a software developer with a propensity for logic games and a conscience stacked with altruistic dreams. I hope to find a blend of these two facets in a career and aspire to be an active contributor and constant learner in the developer community.

      In my spare time, my loves are traveling, the outdoors, peanut butter, and menswear. Oh, and documenting it all. One sample video of a roadtrip I took with two friends is below.
